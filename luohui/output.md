## BUSINESS REVIEW

## Overall Financial Performance

For the Reporting Period, we achieved an operatin ${\tt9}$ revenue of RMB103.7 million, representing an increase of 90.1% as compared to the six months ended June 30, 202 $2,$ with $^\mathrm{a}$ consolidated gross profit margin of approximately 60.5%. Our revenue was mainl $\mathtt{Y}$ contributed by the sales of more than ten products, including but not limited to Youshiying®(優施警®)， Ou Qin®(欧沁®)， Emadine®(埃美丁e), Xalatan®(摘利達®)， Kangwenjuan®(康文涓@). Our R&D expenses amounted to RMB73.1 million, representing a decrease of 25.8% as compared to the six months ended June $3 0$ , 2022. Our adjusted net loss amounted to RMB125.9 million, which increased by 63.8% as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022. In the first half of 2023, the market of ophthalmic drugs has significantly recovered from COVID-19. We have seized such opportunity and made great progress in market exploring and customer development.

## Research and Development Performance

During the Reporting Period, we seized the opportunity in the recovery of ophthalmic diagnosis and treatment and accelerated the R&D of new clinical drugs. The NDA of OT-1001 (0.24% cetirizine eye drop), an innovative drug of our Company, has been accepted by the CDE and has been included in the priority review and approval process of the NMPA. We have completed the enrollment $\mathrm{o f}$ patients for the global phase lll clinical trial for OT-101 (0.01% atropine sulfate eye drop), a new drug to treat the progression of myopia in children. The application of clinical trial authorization for initiating phase lll clinical trial of OT-101-s $( 0. 0 \1 9 /$ and $\circ$ .05% atropine sulfate eye drops), a self-developed product of the Group, has been accepted by CDE, which improves the level $\mathrm{o f}$ convenience for the storage and usage of atropine sulfate. With five dru $9$ candidates in phase lll clinical trials, we continue to be one of the innovative pharmaceutical companies with the largest number of ophthalmic drugs in phase lll clinical trials in China. We will seek to put more efforts to strengthen our R&D capabilities and overcome new technical barriers for ophthalmic preparations, and continuously improve the competitiveness of our products.

## Progress of Our Key Drug Candidates

## OT-101 (0.01% atropine sulfate eye drop)

OT-101, a low-concentration (0.01%) atropine eye drop for retarding or slowing down the progression of myopia in children and adolescents, completed the enrollment of 170 patients in China in February 2023 for its global phase ll randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel and multi-center clinical trial.

ln June 2023, OT-101 completed the enrollment of 678 patients for the global phase ll randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group and multi-center clinical trial.

We expect to continue to advance the phase lll clinical trials this year.

$$
\mathrm{M a n a g e m e n t \, D i s c u s s i o n \, a l}
$$
nd $\mathrm{A n a l y s i s}$ 

O7-101-5 (0.01% and 0.05% atropine sulfate eye drops)

In July 2023, the application of clinical trial authorization for initiating phase ll clinical trial of OT-101-S, a low-concentration (0.01% and 0.05%) atropine sulfate eye drop developed to slow down the progression of myopia in children, in China was accepted $\mathrm{b y}$ CDE. As compared to OT-101, which is designed to contain two chambers of atropine sulfate lyophilized powder and solvent for each dosage unit, OT-101-S is designed to contain two chambers of atropine sulfate concentrated solution and diluted solution for each dosage unit (both preservative-free), and before use, two chambers are mixed to make low-concentration atropine sulfate eye drops, thus leading to a higher level of convenience for the storage and usage of atropine sulfate. The neutral solution environment also significantly improves the compliance and effectiveness of the product.

We expect that the progress achieved in the clinical trial of $O T-1 O 1-S$ will shorten the registration and marketing period of our low-concentration atropine products.

## OT-1001 (ZERVIATE, 0.24% cetirizine eye drop)

In April 2023, the NDA of OT-1001 was accepted by the NMPA and was included in the priority review and approval process. OT-1001 is the first and only eye drop formulation of the antihistamine cetirizine, the active ingredient in ZYRTEC@ which is used for ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. The inclusion of OT-1001 in the priority review and approval process of NMPA will speed up the review and approval process of its NDA, which is an important step towards commercialization of OT-1001.

## OT-702 (aflibercept biosimilar)

OT-702, a recombinant human vascular endothelial growth factor receptor antibody fusion protein ophthalmic injection, completed the enrollment of all patients for the phase lll cinical trial in March 2023.

We expect to further advance the phase ll clinical trials this year.

## O7-502 (DEXYCU, dexamethasone implant)

During the Reporting Period, we continued to advance the real-world study and phase lll clinical trials for OT-502.

We expect to organize data and prepare NDA documents in the second half of 2023.

## OT-202 (tyrosine kinase inhibitor)

In February 2023, the Company initiated the phase ll clinical trial of $\mathrm{O T-2 0. 2}$ a class I innovative drug for the treatment of dry eye. In its phase l clinical trial successfully completed in February $2 0 2 3$ ，OT-202 demonstrated good safety and tolerability profile in healthy adult subjects

We expect to complete the enrollment of patients for phase ll clinical trials in the second half of 2023

INTERIM REPORT 2023 ## Management Discussion and Analysis

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ULTIMATELY DEVELOP AND/OR MARKET OUR CORE PRODUCT AND/OR DRUG CANDIDATES SUCCESSFULLY.

## Commercialization Performance

For the Reporting Period, we achieved an operating revenue of RMB103.7 million from commercialized products, representing an increase of 90.1% as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022. We continued accelerating the penetration $\mathrm{o f}$ our drugs in hospitals in the PRC ophthalmology market, achieving a coverage of 9,361 hospitals nationwide, 1,426 of which are Grade lll hospitals. With a commercialization team of $2 1 0$ employees, we have continued expanding our business network coverage nationwide.

During the Reporting Period, we officially launched the commercialization of Youshiying® (fluocinolone intravitreal implant), a new drug for the treatment of chronic non-infectious uveitis. Uveitis is a complex eye disease, including but not limited to iritis and iridocyclitis, choroiditis, peripheral inflammation and degeneration of retina and vascular, retinal pigment epithelium, vitreous body and optic nerve. Disease can cause significant effects on patients, and specifically, each episode of inflammation of uveitis would cause irreversible damage to the intraocular tissues of patients, among which an average number of 46% of patients will eventually develop into irreversible visual impairment, even blindness. Uveitis is the second most common eye disease in China causing blindness.

Youshiying" can release fluocinolone and has precise effects on the lesion at an initial rate of 0.25 mcg per day through proprietary technology of patent, releasing fluocinolone to the eye for up to 36 months, so as to keep efficacy stable during the whole treatment. It helos patients to stabilize uveitis in the long run and redluce the recurrences $\mathrm{o f}$ uveitis, avoiding damage to intraocular tissues and decreased visual acuity caused $\mathrm{b y}$ recurrences of uveitis. At the same time, this drug only has efect on eyes instead of body, which can greatly reduce the adverse side effect brought by oral corticosteroids.

The signing ceremony for strategic cooperation on Youshiying" between the Company and Shanghai Pharmaceutical $\textsc{c o}$ ., Ltd.(上蔡控股有限公司)（"Shaphar"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding $\mathsf{C o}$ ., Ltd., whose shares are listed on the Stock Exchange (stock code: 2607) and Shanghai Stock Exchange (stock code: 601607), was held on February $2 1$ , 2023. Upon reaching the agreement on strategic cooperation, the parties will further integrate resources and strengthen the overall cooperation on Youshiying® in China $\mathrm{t o}$ benefit all patients. Focusing on pre-marketing service, import and distribution, with the support from its controlled network nationwide and other aspects, Shaphar will also deepen its cooperation and further consolidate strategic partnership with us.

We have progressively expanded our market through organizing and holding academic conferences discussing advanced diagnosis and treatment of uveitis. At the first national training conference for vitreous chamber standardized implantation, renowned scholars and professionals in the field of uveitis introduced a more practical and standardized guideline for the injection of Youshiying@ to the clinicians and physicians in attendance.

## Manufacturing Performance

During the Reporting Period, we mainly focus on pilot scale production and validation batch production of our products at our Suzhou manufacture site, such as Emadine". Additionally, we maintained the ongoing production of products transferred from other manufacture sites, such as Ou Qin@.

## FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND OUTLOOK

Over the past three years, we have made remarkable achievements. In particular, we successfully developed and marketed our Core Product Youshiying@, broadened our product pipeline, built a high-quality production base and promoted our products. In the second half of 2023, we will keep focusing on the following aspects:

1) We will keep speeding up the progress of new product development and plan to facilitate at least two new drug candidates to enter registration stage, keeping our pace of continuous launch of new products.

2) We expect our Suzhou manufacture site to achieve commercialized mass production to ensure stability of supply and quality of products

3) We will spare no efforts in the promotion of our Core Product, Youshiying", to ensure its successful marketing with the aim of benefiting a larger number of patients

4) We will enhance our efforts in marketing and promotion of our other drugs, including Xalatan", Xalacom®(滴利加®),Betoptic® $\mathsf{S}$ （具特舒 $\emptyset)$ , Emadine® and AZEP®(愛塞平@), thus to strengthen our leading position in the fields of the treatment of uveitis, anti-allergy and glaucoma and maintain the exponential growth of our sales revenue.

5) We are committed to strengthen the development of our corporate culture, establishing a distinctive identity that will serve as a foundation for our sustainable growth and advancement in the upcoming phase.

Going forward, we will upholding the philosophy of "Virtus et Lumen", be committed to providing comprehensive solution with patients to protect their eyes and further to improve their quality of life. We will continue to make efforts to create better results and value for our Shareholders and investors, making our Company a leader in the industry of ophthalmology.

## Management Discussion and Analysis

## Revenue

The revenue of our Group increased from RMB54.5 million for the six months ended June $3 0,$ 2022 to RMB103.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase was mainly attributable to (i) a significant increase in the revenue generated from the sales of our ophthalmic products; and (il) an increase in the revenue generated from the pharmaceutical products promotion services, in particular, the promotion services provided by the Group to Viatris in relation to Xalatan and Xalacom@; partially offset by the decrease in the sales-based royalty income in relation to licensing ophthalmic pharmaceutical products to a third party. The following table sets forth the components of our revenue for the periods indicated:

Giv manthe andad liunn 2n

|  | sxmontns ended june s0 |  | sxmontns ende 2023 RMB'OOO (Unaudited)  | oJune30 2022 RMB'OOO (Unaudited) |  | RMB'OOO (Unaudited) | RMB'OOO (Unaudited) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sales of ophthalmic products | 84,216 | 28,219 |
| Pharmaceutica products promotion services | 18,185 | 8,608 |
| Sales-based royalty income | 1,035 | 17,708 |
| Contract development and manufacturing services | 260 |  |
| Total Revenue | 103,696 | 54,535 |

The increase in our revenue was primarily attributable to (i) an increase of 198.4% in the sales of ophthalmic pharmaceutical products from RMB28.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 to RMB84.2 milion for the six months ended June 30, 2023; and (ii) an increase in the revenue generated from the provision of pharmaceutical products promotion services from RMB8 $6$ million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 to RMB18.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023; partially offset by the decrease in the revenue generated from the sales-based royalty income from RMB17.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 to RMB1.0 million for the six months ended June $3 0$ , 2023 as the relevant revenue was recorded as revenue from sales of ophthalmic products instead $\mathrm{o f}$ revenue from sales-based royalty income. The change in revenue recognition was due to the change of business model of Emadine during the Reporting Period.

For the sale of ophthalmic products, revenue is recognized when the control of goods is transferred, being the time when the goods are delivered to the location specified $\mathrm{b y}$ customers, i.e. when the products are delivered and titles are passed to customers upon receipt by customer. For pharmaceutical products promotion services, revenue is recognized when we satisfy the obligation to arrange for sales and/or delivery of pharmaceutical products pursuant to the service contracts. The sales-based royalty income is based on the profit margin of each sale and is recognized at a point of time upon the customer completes its sales.

## Cost of Sales

Our cost of sales consists of purchase price of goods and amortization of license rights. The cost of sales of our Group increased from RMB20. $2$ million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 to RMB41.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase was mainly due to the increased cost in relation to our sales of ophthalmic products and amortization of license rights, which was generally in line with our revenue growth.

## Management Discussion and Analysis

## Gross Profit

The gross profit of our Group increased by 82.8% from RMB34.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 to RMB62.. $7$ million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in our gross profit was mainly in line with our revenue growth.

## Other Income

Our other income mainly consists of bank interest income arising from our bank deposit and government grant income. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, our other income was RMB14.4 million, representing a decrease of RMB0.8 million from RMB15.2 million for the six months ended June $3 0, \, 2 0 2 2$ , primarily due to the decrease in bank interest income.

## Other Gains and Losses

For the six months ended June $3 0, ~ 2 0 2 3$ , our other gains and losses primarily consist of (i) net foreign exchange gains of RMB2.6 million, as compared to the net foreign exchange gains of RMB11. $7$ million for the six months ended June $3 0, ~ 2 0 2 2,$ which is primarily because the appreciation of the USD against RMB narrowed during the Reporting Period as compared to the corresponding period last year; and (ii) the gain of RMB1 $2 ~$ million from changes in fair value of other financial assets as compared to the gain of RMB0.3 million from changes in fair value of other financial assets for the six months ended June $3 0, ~ 2 0 2 2$ , which was primarily attributable to our effective short-term cash management.

## Selling and Marketing Expenses

Our selling and marketing expenses mainly consist of (i) salary and benefits expenses for our commercialization team; (ii) share-based payments for our commercialization team; and lil) marketing and promotion expenses. For the six months ended June $3 0,$ 2023, our selling and marketing expenses were RMB114.7 million, representing an increase of RMB36.0 million from RMB78.7 million for the six months ended June $3 0$ , 2022, which was primarily due to (i) the expansion of our commercialization team; and (ii the increasing marketing and promotion activities for our products post $\mathrm{C O V I D-1 9}$ .

## Management Discussion and Analysis

R&D Expenses

During the Reporting Period, we recorded R&D expenses of RMB73.1 million, representing a decrease of 25.8% from RMB98.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, which was primarily due to the decrease in staff costs, partially offset by (i) the increase in third-party contracting costs, and (ii) the increase in depreciation and amortization.

The following table sets forth the components of our R&D expenses for the periods indicated:

civ manthe andad luna 20

|  |  2023 RMB'000 (Unaudited) |  2022 RMB'OOO (Unaudited) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Third-party contracting costs | 28,781 | 21,195 |
| Staff costs | 35,422 | 73,608 |
| Depreciation and amortization | 4,448 | 890 |
| Others | 4,440 | 2,746 |
| Total R&D expenses | 73,091 | 98,439 |

## Administrative Expenses

Our administrative expenses consist of (i) salaries and other expenses such as benefits, travel and share-based payments (il) professional service fee; and (ill) depreciation and amortization of the property for the purpose of administrative use and right-of-use assets.

For the six months ended June 30, 2023, our administrative expenses were RMB99.6 million, representing an increase of RMB24.2 million from RMB75.4 million for the six months ended June 30, $2 0 2 2$ , which was primarily due to (i) an increase in operational costs incurred for the trial production at our Suzhou manufacture site; and i) an increase in the depreciation of property for the purpose of administrative use at our Suzhou manufacture site and the depreciation of right-of-use assets during the Reporting Period.

## Income Tax Expenses

Our income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was RMBO.1 million, representing a decrease of RMB0.3 million from RMBO.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, which was primarily because no taxable sublicense income was generated during the Reporting Period as compared to the same period in 2022.

## Loss for the Period

As a result of the above factors, for the six months ended June 30, 2023, our loss was RMB208.4 million, representing an increase of RMB15. $7$ million from RMB192. $7$ million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, which is mainly attributed to the increased costs and expenses incurred by (i) the pilot scale production and validation batch production of our product candidates at our Suzhou manufacture site; and (ii) the increasing marketing and promotion activities for our products as compared to the same period in $2 0 2 2$ .

## Non-IFRS Measures

To supplement our consolidated financial statements which are presented in accordance with IFRS, we also use adjusted net loss for the period, a non-IFRS measure to present our operating performance.

Adjusted net loss for the period, as an additional financial measure, is not required by, or presented in accordance with IFRS. We believe that such non-IFRS measure facilitates comparisons of our operating performance from period to period by eliminating impacts of non-cash items that our management considers to be not indicative of our operating performance, and provides useful information to Shareholders and investors to evaluate our operating results in the same manner as our management does. However, our presentation of the adjusted net loss for the period may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. The use of such non-IFRS measure has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as substitute for analysis $\mathrm{o f}$ , our results of operations or financial position as reported under IFRS. We define adjusted net loss for the period as loss for the period adjusted by adding back share-based payments. The following table reconciles our non-IFRS adjusted net loss for the period with our loss for the period, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated with IFRS financial results:

Six months ended June 30

|  |  2023 RMB'000 (Unaudited) |  2022 RMB'OOO (Unaudited) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Loss for the period | (208,402) | (192,669 |
| Adlo: |
| Share-based payments | 82,509 | 115,819 |
| Non-IFRS adjusted net loss for the period | (125,893) | (76,850) |

## Working Capital and Source of Capital

Our primary uses of cash related to (i) R&D expenses in relation to the clinical trials for our drugs and/or drug candidates; (il) expenses and costs for our daily operation and commercial promotion activities; and (ii) final payments in relation to the construction project and production equipment at our Suzhou manufacture site, as well as operational costs and fees incurred for the on-site trial production. We primarily funded our working capital needs through equity financing and cash generated from (i) the sales of YUTIQ, Ou Qin, brimonidine tartrate eye drop, Emadine@ and Kangwenjuan@;(ii) the pharmaceutical products promotion services in relation to Xalatan and Xalacom $\mathbb{\mathbb{E}}$ ; and ii) the sales-based royalty income in relation to Betoptic@ S. We monitor and maintain a level of cash and cash equivalents deemed adequate to finance our operations and mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows. As of June $3 0$ , 2023, our cash and cash equivalents amounted to RMB537.0 million (as of December $3 1$ , 2022: RMB1,170.0 million). The decrease in our cash and cash equivalents is primarily due to our primary uses of cash in the aspects stated above and placement of term deposits. Currently, we follow a set $\mathrm{o f}$ funding and treasury policies to manage our capital resources and mitigate potential risks involved.

## Borrowings

As of June $3 0, \, 2 0 2 3$ , we did not have any borrowings (as of December $3 1, \, 2 0 2 2 \! : \mathrm{n i l} )$ .

## Capital Commitment

As of June 30, 2023, we have capital commitment of RMB35.9 million for the contracts in relation to acquisition of property, plant and equipment (as of December 31, 2022: RMB49.0 million).

## Contingent Liabilities

As of June $3 0, \, 2 0 2 3$ , we did not have any material contingent liabilities, guarantees or any litigation against us (as of December $3 1, \, 2 0 2 2 \! : \mathrm{n i l} ).$ 

## Pledge of Assets

As of June 30, 2023, we pledged RMB23.9 million deposits to a bank to secure the letter of credit granted to the Group (as of December 31, 2022: RMB26.0 million).

## Gearing Ratio

Gearing ratio is calculated using interest-bearing borrowings less cash and cash equivalents and term deposits with initial term $\mathrm{o f}$ over three months, divided by total equity and multiplied by $1 0 0 9 /$ . As $\mathrm{o f}$ June $3 0, \, 2 0 2 3$ , we were in a net cash position and thus, gearing ratio is not applicable.

INTERIM REPORT 2023 ## Management Discussion and Analysis

Material Investments, Acquisitions and Disposals

We entered into a share purchase agreement with EyePoint in December 2020, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire $3, 0 1 0, 7 2 2$ shares $\mathrm{o f}$ EyePoint for a total consideration of approximately US$15.7 million (equivalent to approximately HK$121.8 milion). Upon completion of such investment in January 2021, we held approximately 16.6% of the enlarged total outstanding shares of EyePoint. Subsequent to such investment, as a result of share allotment and issue of new ordinary shares by EyePoint, the Group's shareholding in EyePoint was further diluted.

As of June 30, 2023, the carrying amount of our investment in EyePoint as equity instruments at FVTOCl was approximately RMB189.3 million (as of December 31, 2022: RMB73.4 million). According $\mathrm{l y}$ , the fair value $\mathrm{o f}$ such investment compared to our total assets as of June 30, 2023 was approximately 6.3%. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, we have not received any dividend from such investment.

Save as disclosed above, the Company did not have any other material investments, acouisitions or disposals of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures during the six months ended June 30, 2023.

## Future Plans for Material Investments or Capital Assets

As of the date of this interim report, we plan to continue to invest in the construction of our Suzhou manufacture site to enhance the manufacturing capacity to satisfy our long-term development strategies.

Saved as disclosed above, we do not have any concrete future plans for material capital expenditure, investments or capital assets as of the date of this interim report. We will make further announcements in accordance with the Listing Rules, where applicable, if any investments and acquisition opportunities materialize.

## Foreign Exchange

Foreign currency risk refers to the risk of loss resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Certain of our bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables are denominated in foreign currencies, and are exposed to foreign currency risk. Our Group currently implements foreign currency hedging measures under our funding and treasury policies. In addition, we will continue to manage the foreign exchange risk by closely monitoring our foreign exchange exposure and will consider implementing more detailed measures as needed to hedge significant foreign currency exposure thus to prevent significant net foreign exchange losses in the future.

We provide formal and comprehensive company-level and department-level training to our new employees, followed by on-the-job training. We also provide training and development programs to our employees from time to time to ensure their awareness and compliance with our various policies and procedures. Some of the training is conducted jointly by departments serving different functions but working with or supporting each other in our day-to-day operations.

The remuneration of the employees of our Group comprises salaries, bonuses, employees' provident fund, share-based payments, social security contributions and other welfare payments which is determined by their responsibilities, qualifications, positions and seniority. The Group regularly reviews and determines the remuneration and compensation package of the employees by reference to, among other things, their performance, qualifications, respective responsibilities and market levels of salaries paid $\mathrm{b y}$ comparable companies. In accordance with applicable laws and regulations, we made contributions to social security insurance funds (including pension plans, medical insurance, work-related injury insurance, unemployment insurance and maternity insurance) and housing funds for our employees.

We have also adopted the ESOP, the RSU Scheme, the 2021 Share Option Scheme and the 2021 Share Award Scheme to provide incentives for our employees.

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF OCUMENSION THERAPEUTICS (Incorporated in the Cayman lslands with limited liability)

## INTRODUCTION

We have reviewed the condensed consolidated financial statements of Ocumension Therapeutics (the "Company") and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the "Group $\prime\prime)$ set out on pages 33 to 60, which comprise the condensed consolidated statement of financial position as of June 30, 2023 and the related condensed consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement $\mathrm{o f}$ cash flows for the six-month period then ended, and certain explanatory notes. The Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited require the preparation of a report on interim financial information to be in compliance with the relevant provisions thereof and International Accounting Standard 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" ("IAS 34") issued $\mathrm{b y}$ the International Accounting Standards Board. The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with IAS 34. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these condensed consolidated financial statements based on our review, and to report our conclusion solely to you, as a body, in accordance with our agreed terms of engagement, and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility towards or accept liability to any other person for the contents of this report.

## SCOPE OF REVIEW

We conducted our review in accordance with Hong Kong Standard on Review Engagements 2410 "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity $\prime\prime$ issued $\mathrm{b y}$ the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of these condensed consolidated financial statements consists $\mathrm{o f}$ making inquiries, primarily $\mathrm{o f}$ persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. $\mathrm{A}$ review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Hong Kong Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

## CONCLUSION

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed consolidated financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34..

INTERIM REPORT 2023 ## Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financia Statements

For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2023

## 1. BASIS OF PREPARATION

The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 "Interim Financial Reportin $\mathrm{g^{'^{\prime}}}$ issued by the International Accounting Standards Board $(^{\mathrm{'^{\prime}}} \mathrm{I A S B}^{\mathrm{'^{\prime}}} )$ as well as the applicable disclosure requirements of Appendix 1 $6$ to the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.

## 2. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments, which are measured at fair values.

Other than the change in accounting policies resulting from the application of the amendments to International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRSs"), the accounting policies and methods of computation used in the condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2023 are the same as those presented in the annual consolidated financial statements of Ocumension Therapeutics (the "Company $\lceil^{\prime\prime} \rangle$ and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the "Group") for the year ended December $3 1, \, 2 0 2 2.$ 

## Application of amendments to IFRSs

In the current interim period, the Group has applied the following new and amendments to IFRSs issued by the IASB, for the first time, which are mandatorily effective for the Group's annual period beginning on January 1, 2023 for the preparation of the Group's condensed consolidated financial statements:

IFRS 17 (including the June and
December 2021 Amendments
to IFRS 17）
Amendments to IAS 8
Amendments to IAS 12 Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from

$$
\mathrm{a ~ \sl~ S i n g l e ~ T r a n s a c t i o n}
$$

Amendments to IAS 12 International Tax Reform-Pillar Two model Rules

Except as described below, the application of the new and amendments to IFRSs in the current interim period has had no material impact on the Group's financial position and performance for the current and prior periods and/or on disclosures set out in these condensed consolidated financial statements.

## 2. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued

lmpacts and changes in accounting policies on application of Amendments to IAS 12 Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction

$$
A c c o u n t i n g \; p o l i c i e s
$$

Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognized if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of assets and liabilities in $^\mathrm{a}$ transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit and at the time of the transaction does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. ln addition, deferred tax liabilities are not recognized if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill.

## Transition and summary of effects

As disclosed in the Group's annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022, the Group previously applied the IAS 12 requirements to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction as a whole and temporary differences relating to the relevant assets and liabilities were assessed on a net basis. Upon the application of the amendments, the Group assessed the relevant assets and liabilities separately. In accordance with the transition provision:

(i) the Group has applied the new accounting policy retrospectively to leasing transactions that occurred on or after January $1, \, 2 0 2 2 ;$ 

(ii) the Group also, as at January 1, 2022, recognized a deferred tax asset (to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised) and a deferred tax liability for all deductible and taxable temporary difference associated with right-of-use-assets and lease liabilities.

The application of the amendments has had no material impact on the Group's financial position and performance, except that the Group recognized the related deferred tax assets of RMB6,114,000 and deferred tax liabilities of RMB $6, \! 1 1 4, \! 0 0 0$ on a gross basis but offsetting upon presentation. It has no impact on the retained earnings at the earliest period presented.

## 3. REVENUE AND SEGMENT NFORMATION

The following is an analysis of the Group's revenue:

|  | Six months ended June 30, |  |  2023 RMB'OOO (unaudited) |  2022 RMB'OOO (unaudited) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Types of goods or service |
| At a point in time |
| Sales of ophthalmic products | 84,216 | 28,219 |
| Pharmaceutical products promotion services | 18,185 | 8,608 |
| Sales-based royalty income | 1,035 | 17,708 |
| Contract development and manufacturing ("CDMO") services | 260 |  |
|  | 103,696 | 54,535 |

## Sales of ophthalmic products

For the sale of ophthalmic products, revenue is recognized when control of the goods has transferred, being when the goods have been delivered to the customer's specific location, i.e. when the products are delivered and titles have passed to customers upon receipt by customer. Following delivery, the customer has the primary responsibility when selling the goods and bears the risk of obsolescence and loss in relation to the goods. A receivable is recognized by the Group when the goods are delivered to customers as this represents the point in time at which the right to consideration becomes unconditional, as only the passage of time is required before payment is due. The normal credit term is 30 to 90 days upon delivery. Under the Group's standard contract terms, customers can only return or request refund if the goods delivered do not meet required quality standards. Therefore, the probability of significant reversal in revenue in relation to sales return in the future is remote.

Fnr the Six Month Fnded lune 30 2023

## 3. REVENUE AND SEGMENT INFORMATION(Continued)

Pharmaceutical products promotion services

For pharmaceutical products promotion services, the Group is an agent under the pharmaceutical products promotion services contracts as its performance obligation is mainly to arrange for sales and delivery $\mathrm{o f}$ pharmaceutical products supplied by another parties. In this regard, the Group does not control the products provided by another parties before those goods sold and delivered to customers. Accordingly, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the Group satisfies its obligation to arrange for sales and/or delivery of pharmaceutical products pursuant to the service contracts. The normal credit term is 30 to 45 days. Payment for services is not due from the customers until the Group's customer has received settlements for its sales or accepted the compliance report for promotion activities, as appropriate, and therefore a contract asset is recognized at the point of time in which the services are performed. No further obligation is borne by the Group after the promotion services have been completed.

## Sales-based royalty income

The Group grants its license right to a customer for product sales in exchange for sales-based royalty income. The income is based on the profit margin of each sale and is recognized at a point of time upon the customer completes its sales. Such income is settled by month with the normal credit period of 60 days.

## CDMO services

The Group starts to earn revenues by providing CDMO services to its customer through fee-for-service $(^{\mathrm{^{\tiny~ n} \! ~ F F S}}^{\mathrm{^{\tiny~ n} \!}} )$ contracts. Under FFS method, the contracts usually have multiple deliverable units, which are generally in the form $\mathrm{o f}$ samples and/or products, each with individual selling price specified within the contract. The Group identifies each deliverable unit as a separate performance obligation and recognizes FFS revenue of contractual elements at the point in time upon the units delivered.

## Segment information

The Group's chief operating decision maker $(^{'^{\prime}} \mathrm{C O D M^{'^{\prime}}} )$ , being the executive directors of the Company. regularly reviews revenue by products; however, no other discrete information was provided. In addition, the CODM reviewed the consolidated results when making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance as a whole. Hence, no further segment information other than entity wide information was presented.

No analysis of the Group's assets and liabilities by operating segments is disclosed as it is not regularly provided to the CODM for review.

All revenue from external customers is attributed to the Group and all non-current assets of the Group are located in the People's Republic of China (the $\mathrm{^{\prime\prime} P R C^{'^{\prime}} )}$ .

ln estimating the fair value, the Group uses market-observable data to the extent it is available. Where Level 1 inputs are not available, the Group engages third party qualified valuers to perform the valuation. The finance department of the Company works closely with the qualified external valuers to establish the appropriate valuation techniques and inputs to the model.

The fair values of these financial assets and financial liabilities are determined (in particular, the valuation technique(s) and inputs used), as well as the level of the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurements are categorised (Levels 1 to 3) based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements is observable.

Level 1 fair value measurements are based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active market for identical assets or liabilities;

Level $2 ~$ fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and

Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

Fair value of the Group's financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Other financial assets |  |  | Level 3 | Discounted cash flow which was estimated bared or expected return, discounted at a rate that reflects the risk of underlying investments  |
| Listed equity securities at FVTOCI  | 213,425 | 95,000 | Level 1 | Quoted bid prices in an active market |

There were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 during the period..
